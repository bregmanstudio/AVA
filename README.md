Audio Visual datAbase - feature agnostic scalable storage and similarity-based retrieval 

This is AVA, a database system specialized towards approximate
content-based retrieval of audio and visual sequence features. Now
developed at Dartmouth College, the project is based on AudioDB (2007+) which
was developed at Goldsmiths, University of London as part of the
OMRAS2 research project (funded by the Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council, grant number: EP/E02274X/1).
