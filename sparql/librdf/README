Quick Installation
==================

Requires: librdf, audioDB. 

Compilation should just be: 

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

The storage module will then be installed in your lib/redland directory,
with the storage creatable with the 'audiodb' type, a la:

storage = librdf_new_storage(world, "audiodb", "mydb.adb", NULL);
