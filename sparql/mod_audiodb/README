Quick Installation
==================

Requires: apreq2, audioDB, apxs

Ensure that you have something like the following in your httpd.conf:

#LoadModule directive to aid module installations
#LoadModule dummy_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_dummy.so
LoadModule apreq_module    /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_apreq2.so
LoadModule audiodb_module     /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_audiodb.so

Then you should be able to do:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

Configuration
=============

To configure the database, add the following to your site configuration:

<Location /sparql>
	DatabasePath "/tmp/test_database.adb"
	SetHandler audiodb-sparql-handler
</Location>

Where /tmp/test_database.adb is the location of your audioDB database,
(the file must be readable by the user that apache runs as), and /sparql
is the path to your endpoint.

Usage
=====

Queries may be submitted to the endpoint by GET or POST, with 'query'
containing the SPARQL query, and 'output' containing either text/json
or application/sparql-results+xml (the default). A 400 response occurs
on error.
